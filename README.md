# OSG Frontend Assessment | Course List

Thank you for applying to OSG and taking the time out to complete this assessment!

## The Goal
This assessment isn't to waste your time or an attempt to stump you with something you would be actually tasked with. The purpose here is for us to see a base level example of how you work.

## The Assessment
With this assessment we are asking you fully complete the given tasks by delivering on the acceptance criteria to the best of your ability. In general, we are looking for your attention to detail, code clarity, and code efficiency.

## Getting Started
The first thing you'll need to create a github account if you don't have one then click the "Use this template" button and go through the process of creating a new repository. We would prefer for you to keep the repo public but we understand if you have reservations about that. If you go with the private option, please remember to add us to the repo after you've completed this assessment.

> This assessment is based in nodejs, so you will need to have that installed along with npm.

Once you have your repo created, you will need to install some dependencies.

`npm install`

> One the dependencies is [parcelJS](https://parceljs.org/) (you don't need an understanding of parcel for this assessment) you may need to install this package globally.

After the dependencies have completed installing, start the application to make sure its working.

`npm run start`

The expected result is for a local server to have been spun up at `http://localhost:5000`. You should see a page with a "Thank you for applying!" message. Making a to any of the source files should cause the app to be refreshed.

Now you're ready to begin!
